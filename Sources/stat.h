/**
This library uses some 'tricks' in order to perform statistical
analysis without storing each data point - thus making it micro-
friendly. To save even more memory there are two versions - a floating
point and an integer version. The integer version saves about 200
bytes of SRAM if you don't require floating point in your code.

In order to avoid storing individual data points, a running total
is stored instead. When creating the Statistics object, the sample
size is chosen. When data overruns this sample size, older values are
sloughed off the total. The way this is done is by sloughing off the
average of all the points collected.

In a similar way, the variance is stored (from which std deviation
is calculated). Normally, the variance is the sum of the squares of
the difference between the data points and the mean. Since the mean
is not yet known, the square of the actual data point is used instead.
Then, when it is time to calculate the variance, the mean squared times
the number of data points is subtracted from the variance total. This
turns out to be the true variance by virtue of associative principle.
